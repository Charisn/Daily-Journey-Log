This is an operation i tried for a complex data migration.

We were presented with a false xlsx of data. 

There were multiple ids mixed with models. Many of the ids were not integers and could not even be stored.

The presented data were so mixed up we could not even manually collect them.

We also had to migrate product options from an older system of ours into a newer one in order to make a customers request fulfilled which was also a complicated task too.

These python scripts do several different jobs collecting and matching data from different xl sheets creating a single sheet of managable for me data which i then took and recreate a single xl which was 
easier for us to store into the database.

Scripts require the files path in order to execute and a library called panda s.
