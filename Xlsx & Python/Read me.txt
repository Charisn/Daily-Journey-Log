Recently, I was entrusted with a substantial data migration task, which, to put it mildly, presented several challenges. Upon receiving an Excel file, ostensibly containing the necessary data, I was met with a chaotic assemblage of models and IDs. Disconcertingly, many of the IDs were not formatted as integers, thereby inhibiting their storability.

In tandem with this, I faced the task of migrating product options from an antiquated system to a more modern one, a customer requirement that was pivotal to fulfill.

My approach involved crafting several Python scripts, each with a specific role in collecting and aligning data from various Excel sheets. This process facilitated the creation of a singular, cohesive sheet, which I utilized to reconstruct a well-ordered Excel file. This resultant file proved far more manageable and was seamlessly stored into our database.

For those familiar with data troubleshooting, employing scripts and utilizing a library like "pandas" can significantly streamline such a time-intensive process.
