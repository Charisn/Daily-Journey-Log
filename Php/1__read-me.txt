Before and during the release of our api v1 for standard e-shops integrated by all Epsilon ERPS to create ecommerce pressence for all clients, we had approximately 3000+ test e-shops for testing the integration in different levels.

During this time we encountered an issue of the server space. We realised that the server was completely full and we started an operation to delete all test e-shops.

After successfully deleting all of them we realised that after a routine operation for ssl configs, all those e-shops "came back from the dead".

After some digging we realised that our main integrations logic for deleting the e-shop encountered an error during the delete subdomain. 

I created a php script in the server that finds all the "undead" subdomains, deletes their subdomain from cpanel calling a different file i created utilizing cpanel api and then deleting its dir.
