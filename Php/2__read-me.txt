Mass Image Renamer
In a mass product images import from an older e-shop database to a new database for one of our ERPs, a partner encountered an issue.
How would he assign the images to the products since the ids were renewed from int to guid?
Also there were some extra variables that he needed to take into consideration.

When the issue came into my attention i created this php script that renames the images into the id(model) which was a good unique identifier + some variables required into the ERP for a proper migration, which we then downloaded localy and with a mysql script could be able to insert them into the ERP database via their name.
