When manually migrating data from different types of databases into an opencart 3 database there were instances were products were shown into the lists of a parent category but when clicked redirected to a 404 page.

Opencart has a requirement for products were if you have a products into a child category, it needs to have all of its parent categories aswell in order to work.

In some cases, databases only had the id of the child category and it was not time efficient to do it for 1-1 products each time.

So i created this mysql query to insert into table product_category its category parent_id up until category_id = 0 ( which was the last parent ).

This should be run it as many times as the e-shops categories levels.
