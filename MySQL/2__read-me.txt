After a full migration into an e-shop, options were presented in front end with alphabetical order.

In the data we had , sort orders in options were not set and we needed a fast solution to present the final result according to all of customers requests

One of these requess was to present the options in the select boxes with the order he had inserted them into the database.

Database stored in table options: option_id , option_value_id , name and sort_order, which was defaulting to 0 if not set.

Inserting in all options 1-1 the sort orders was not time efficient for more than 2.000 options so i came up with this mysql query.

What it does is it creates a number from 1 and increments it by 1 for each update.

Every time option_id changes it resets the incrementation to 1.

Option_id refers to the select box and option_value_id refers to the values inside that box.

Expected outcome:

Color (option) 
Red (option value) - sort_order = 1
Green (option value) - sort_order = 2
Black (option value) - sort_order = 1
Purple (option value) - sort_order = 3

~Reset increment~

Size (option)
Small  (option value) - sort_order = 1
Medium (option value) - sort_order = 2
Large (option value) - sort_order = 3
